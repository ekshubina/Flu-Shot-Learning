# Flu Shot Learning: Predict H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines

A machine learning project to predict whether people received H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines based on their demographics, opinions, and health behaviors.

## Project Overview

This is a practice competition from [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/) designed to be accessible to participants at all levels. The goal is to build predictive models that can accurately forecast vaccination patterns.

### Problem Statement

Using survey data from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, predict whether respondents received:
- H1N1 flu vaccine
- Seasonal flu vaccine

The dataset includes information about:
- Social and economic background
- Opinions on health risks and vaccine effectiveness  
- Health behaviors and practices
- Demographics
